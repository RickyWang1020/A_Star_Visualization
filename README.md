# A* Shortest Path Finding Algorithm Visualizer

## About this program
This is a small program written using Python (Pygame) that can visualize the process of A* shortest-path finding.

This program is developed on a MacOS device and can run on MacOS devices, but has not yet been tested on a Windows device.

The shortest path gained by A* algorithm will be shown on the PyGame window, and the shortest path length will be shown in the Python Kernel.

## Requirements
- Python
- Pygame

## How to play
1. Point Initializations:
  - Left mouse button - initialize the starting point;
  - Right mouse button - initialize the ending point;
  - Middle mouse button - initialize the obstacles (walls).
2. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> to start the pathfinding algorithm.
3. When one execution is over, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> to re-start the program.
4. Click on the "x" on upper-left corner (for MacOS devices) or press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to exit the program.
